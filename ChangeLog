2004-07-10  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Added focused rule derivation; non-interference for linear
	assumptions; qbf -> MAELL compiler; some hard test cases.

	* frontend/prop.grm: o-o and <-> added.	

2004-06-26  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* top/engine.fun: now uses the new rule interface; no longer has
	any notion of 'unary', 'binary', etc., so when lit2 and rule2 can
	be simply dropped into place.
	
	* core/rule.sml: updated to use new rule type; failures are now
	even earlier

	* core/rule.sig: new rule type

2004-06-23  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* proof/onf.sml: 1&A is normalized to A&1.

	* core/lit.sml: Added a register. utils/label.sml no longer
	defines "associate" and "find".

	* proof/chronicle.sml: Added

	* proof/chronicle.sig: Added

2004-06-21  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* core/lit2.sml: two phase labelling

	* core/lit2.sig: two phase labelling

2004-06-19  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* core/rule.sml: uses the new Sequent.remove functionality The
	operations 'concat' and 'adjoin' are now in sequent.sml, as are
	the weak equality tests (now known as 'affixion').

	* core/sequent.sml: Sequent.extract is gone; replaced with
	Sequent.remove and an extraction mode ('emode') type.
	Additionally, the operations 'join' and 'add' are now defined here
	instead of in rule.sml.

	* core/sequent.sig: updating to new style of additive and
	multiplicative rules; also commented

2004-06-12  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* core/lit.sml: Added invariants for labelling.

	* proof/norm-kc.fun (FoldNormFn.renr): removed the case for Chk,
	so it will raise a Match exception if it gets there.

	* core/lit.sig: Added some comments.

	* core/global.sml: removed.

	* core/prop.sml: Added some comments.

	* core/prop.sig: Added the pskel type and some comments.

	* proof/proof.sml: Added invariant annotations.

	* proof/proof.sig: Added invariant annotations.

2004-06-11  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* proof/norm-kc.fun (FoldNormFn): Added explicit alpha-varying.

2004-06-10  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* proof/norm-kc.fun (FoldNormFn.normc): added a check for a rather
	unimaginable corner case for the elim-applicators. Need to verify
	if that corner case can actually ever arise.
	(FoldNormFn): Cleaned up the invariants; they mostly hold, except
	for APP.

2004-06-08  Kaustuv Chaudhuri  <kaustuv+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* TODO: popped off a few finished things.
