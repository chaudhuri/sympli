(*
 * The affine zone contains free subformulas of the goal sequent (after
 * 1-normalization) that are of the form A&1. However, in linear logic
 * 1 is equivalent to !#, and so these formulas can also be represented
 * as (A & !#). The essential structure of (A & !#) is left untouched
 * during 1-normalization, From a simple examination of the rules, it
 * is clear that (A & !#) has the same affineness properties as A & 1.
 *)

(* For provable formulas &1 generates far fewer sequents than &!# *)

%prove (P & !#) -o (Q & !#) -o (A + B -o C) -o (A -o C) + (B -o C).
%prove (P & 1) -o (Q & 1) -o (A + B -o C) -o (A -o C) + (B -o C).

(* 
 * For unprovable formulas, &!# prevents saturation, whereas &!
 * saturates immediately.
 *)

%refute 1000 : (P & !#) -o (Q & !#) -o (A & B -o C) -o (A -o C) + (B -o C).
%refute (P & 1) -o (Q & 1) -o (A & B -o C) -o (A -o C) + (B -o C).

(* 
 * Thus, it is *much* better to use &1 instead of &!# for locally
 * affine assumptions
 * 
 * In a future version of the prover the 1nf algorithm may be tweaked
 * to account for !#.
